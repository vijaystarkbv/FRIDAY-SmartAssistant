Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and decided it would be best to see a doctor. After consulting with a medical professional, I was advised to take a few days off to rest and recover.

My expected return date is [insert date here], but I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as possible if my absence will be extended. In the meantime, I am more than willing to delegate my tasks or provide any necessary assistance to ensure a smooth workflow.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding in this matter. Please let me know if there are any further steps I need to take or any additional information you require.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
